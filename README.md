# PetzingerPortfolioSite

My project is a portfolio site for my two different possible career paths. Graphic Design and Developer. I used flexbox to organize content areas as well as an expanding and collapsing navbar for various media. The expanding and collapsing is made possible with two media queries. I have used javascript for my "Contact Me" page as well as for my lightbox portfolio. Originally I had intended to create a slideshow for the homepage but once I did I didn't care for the constant movement. I opted to do the lightbox as my javascript requirement instead.
