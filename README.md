Web Development Course I – codeKY
Summer 2022

My project is a visually appealing portfolio site for my two possible career paths. Graphic Designer and Web Developer. 
Open the index.html file to get started...

I have included the following:
•	You must include a minimum of 2 media queries that create a better layout/user experience
•	I have made more than 5 commits to GitHub
•	A navigation menu that expands and collapses properly at desktop and mobile sizes, such as by switching between vertical and horizontal styles, or is opened and closed by clicking the “hamburger” icon
•	Use Flexbox or CSS Grid to organize content areas based on mobile or desktop views. Simply applying a basic flex property so that text wraps as you change screen sizes does not count. You must actually rearrange content or perform some more advanced feature. For example, swapping from a single column layout to a two-column layout on a desktop.
•	Create at least 3 variables (var, const, or let), set their values in JavaScript, and display the values somewhere on your page - these are the headings for the fields on the contact form.
•	I did create the contact form with Javascript however I was not able to pull the information back to populate the "alert"
•	I created the portfolio modal using javascript on the Graphic Designer page.
